## About Me

I am a half-researcher, half-software-engineer with an incomprehensible job title at [Palantir](https://blog.palantir.com/a-day-in-the-life-of-a-palantir-forward-deployed-software-engineer-45ef2de257b1), though all thoughts, opinions and million dollar ideas here are my own, not my employer's (and vice-versa).
I have spent the past decade reading blogs of people I admire, but have become slightly uncomfortable with how much more reading I do than writing. This is an effort to change that.
Overly-chatty children are told that we have two ears and one mouth for a reason. We also have ten fingers, and I've been neglecting them.

I also work part-time in [Colin Raffel's NLP Lab](https://colinraffel.com/), designing tools for collaborative deep learning model development.

Like, I _actually_ would. See above about guiltily doing more reading than writing.
I am the queen of having thoughts and questions and being intimidated to put them to an internet stranger. You don't have to be.

But _genuinely_. Forget about spelling or crafting a topic sentence. Send me a knock-knock joke to practice! Drop the activation energy to _zero_.
